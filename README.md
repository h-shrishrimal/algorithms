| Bit Manipulation      |
|-----------------------|
| left shift            |
| right shift           |
| input power of 2      |
| get ith bit           |
| set ith bit           |
| clear ith bit         |
| update ith bit        |
| clear bits in range   |
| replace bits in range |
| input is odd or even  |
